Search for the fastest confirmation of Goldbach Strong Conjecture (GP)
GP states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.

2n = p1 + p2, 

where:

  n >=2, 
  p1 and p2 are prime numbers 

So far (by 2017) GP has not been proven yet, although has been computationally verified up to 4 Ã— 10^18.
This framework is used to find the fastest computational confirmation method of GP.
  
## Methods based on primality check of one or two components of 2n

## Methods based on possible sum building from already known prime numbers


## Dependencies

Framework depends on https://github.com/mbarylsk/primes which is supporting all required operations on prime numbers.
