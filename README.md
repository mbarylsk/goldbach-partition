# goldbach-partition

Goldbach Strong Conjecture (GP) states that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.

_2n_ = _p_ + _q_

where:

  * _n_ >=2, 
  * _p_ and _q_ are prime numbers 

So far (by 2017) GP has not been proven yet, although has been computationally verified up to _4 Ã— 10^18_.

This framework is used to find the fastest computational confirmation method of GP.
  
## Methods based on primality check of one or two components of 2n



## Methods based on possible sum building from already known prime numbers

## Dependencies

Framework depends on https://github.com/mbarylsk/primes which is supporting all required operations on prime numbers.
